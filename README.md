# School_District_Analysis
## Project Overview

The project was conducted to analyze a school district's testing data while ensuring that all data gathered and analyzed was accurate. To ensure findings were accurate and did not include any skewed data, ninth grade reading and math scores were removed from Thomas High School.

 * The average math score decreased from 79.0 to 78.9
